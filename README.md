Project Description
Face Match is a web app that detects and compares faces from images, letting you know how similar they are. Think ‚ÄúShazam for faces,‚Äù but without the music‚Ä¶ or the fame.
The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People keep forgetting if they look like their friends, celebrities, or the barista who serves them coffee. This lack of face confirmation is a modern tragedy.
The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built an AI tool that compares two faces and gives a similarity score ‚Äî because sometimes, you just need to know if you and Ryan Reynolds are basically twins.
