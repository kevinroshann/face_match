# Face Match üéØ

## Basic Details

### Team Name: Code_Redux

### Team Members
- Member 1: Philip Thomas ‚Äì School of Engineering, CUSAT
- Member 2: Kevin Roshan N ‚Äì School of Engineering, CUSAT

## Project Description
Face Match is a web app that detects and compares faces from images, letting you know how similar they are. Think ‚ÄúShazam for faces,‚Äù but without the music‚Ä¶ or the fame.

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People keep forgetting if they look like their friends, celebrities, or the barista who serves them coffee. This lack of face confirmation is a modern tragedy.

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built an AI tool that compares two faces and gives a similarity score ‚Äî because sometimes, you just *need* to know if you and Ryan Reynolds are basically twins.
