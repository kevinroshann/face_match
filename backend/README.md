Project Description
A groundbreaking, totally unnecessary system that uses facial recognition to recommend the perfect snack for your mood ‚Äî from potato chips to chocolate bars ‚Äî based purely on your face right now.
The Problem (that doesn‚Äôt exist)
Every day, millions of people face a life-altering dilemma: What snack should I eat? This question goes unanswered, leaving many snackless and sad. No one asked for this, but we‚Äôre here anyway.
The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We scan your face using advanced AI (a.k.a. borrowed TensorFlow code) and instantly match your mood to a snack.
Smiling? You get cookies.
Frowning? Sour candy.
Confused? Trail mix.
Crying? A whole tub of ice cream.
